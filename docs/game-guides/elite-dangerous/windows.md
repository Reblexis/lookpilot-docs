# Setting up LookPilot with Elite Dangerous (Windows)

## LookPilot Configuration

1. Launch LookPilot and ensure your head tracking device is connected
2. In the **Output** tab, select `freetrack 2.0 Enhanced` protocol
3. Click **Start** to begin tracking
4. Go to the **Mapping** tab to adjust curves for space exploration

## Elite Dangerous Setup

1. Launch LookPilot before starting Elite Dangerous
2. Start Elite Dangerous
3. Go to **Options** â†’ **Controls**
4. In the **Headlook** section, bind the following axes:
   - **Headlook Horizontal:** TrackIR Yaw
   - **Headlook Vertical:** TrackIR Pitch
   - **Headlook Roll:** TrackIR Roll (optional)
   - **Headlook Zoom:** TrackIR Z (optional)
5. Apply and save the settings

> **ðŸš€ Space Tip:** Use smooth curves to avoid motion sickness during long exploration sessions.

## Troubleshooting

### No tracking detected
- Ensure LookPilot is started before Elite Dangerous
- Check that freetrack 2.0 Enhanced protocol is selected
- Verify headlook axes are bound in Elite Dangerous controls
- Restart both applications if needed

### Motion sickness
- Reduce sensitivity in LookPilot mapping
- Use smoother curves with less aggressive response
- Take breaks during long sessions
- Disable roll tracking if it feels uncomfortable

### Tracking feels unnatural
- Adjust curves in LookPilot for more natural movement
- Fine-tune deadzone settings
- Try different curve presets for space simulation
