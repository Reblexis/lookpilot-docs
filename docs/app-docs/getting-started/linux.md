**Welcome to LookPilot!** This short guide will help you start tracking and get into your first game.

**⚠️ Important for Linux users:** If you have LookPilot installed via Steam, you must use the **.deb version of Steam** for LookPilot to work properly. Alternatively, you can install LookPilot standalone from [lookpilot.app/downloads](https://lookpilot.app/downloads).

## Camera setup

First, make sure your camera is connected. Go to **Settings** (1) → **Camera** (2), choose your webcam in the dropdown (3), then select a resolution and FPS (4). Higher FPS usually feels better, but image quality matters — don't pick the lowest resolution. Confirm you can see yourself in the preview.

## Start tracking

You're ready to start. Click **Start** button (1) or press `Alt+T` (customizable in Settings → Keybinds) in the output pose visualization to start tracking. If needed, re-center with the **Center** button (2) or press `Alt+C` (customizable in Settings → Keybinds). Then launch your game.
