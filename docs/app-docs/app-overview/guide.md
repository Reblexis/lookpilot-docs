# Using the LookPilot Application

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for the LookPilot application. This document will walk you through the main features, interface elements, and how to get started with your new head and eye tracking experience.

## 1. Installation and First Launch

After downloading LookPilot from Steam, launch the application for the first time. The app will automatically detect compatible head tracking devices connected to your system. If you're using a webcam for head tracking, ensure it's properly connected and has adequate lighting.
