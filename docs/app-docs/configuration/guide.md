# LookPilot Configuration Guide

## Output Protocols

Choose the right protocol for your games:
- **freetrack 2.0 Enhanced**: Most flight sims and space games
- **SimConnect**: Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020
- **Mouse Emulation**: Linux games and unsupported titles

## Mapping Settings

### Sensitivity Curves
- Adjust how much head movement translates to in-game movement
- Start with moderate settings and fine-tune

### Smoothing
- Reduces jitter and creates smoother movement
- Increase if tracking feels shaky

### Deadzone
- Small area where minor movements are ignored
- Helps with precision aiming

## Saving Profiles

Create different profiles for different games:
1. Configure settings for a specific game
2. Save the profile with a descriptive name
3. Load profiles when switching games
