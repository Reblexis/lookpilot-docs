## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `freetrack`
2. Click **Start** to begin tracking

## iRacing Setup
iRacing supports head tracking natively through the Freetrack protocol. The game will automatically detect the head tracking input once LookPilot is running.

### Tips for iRacing
- For iRacing, **very subtle head tracking** works best
- Too much movement makes the experience abrupt and disorienting
- Focus primarily on **Yaw** (left/right look) movements
- Keep pitch and translation movements minimal
- Head tracking helps with mirror checks and looking into corners
