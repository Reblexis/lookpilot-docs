## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `auto`
2. Launch the game
3. Select the Automobilista's Wine prefix in `Game's Wine prefix` dropdown
4. Click **Start tracking** to begin tracking and wait for about 10 seconds
5. Click **Stop tracking**
6. Restart the game
7. Click **Start tracking**

### Fallback Option
If the above method doesn't work, try using the freetrack (Wine) protocol:

1. Set protocol to `freetrack (Wine)`
2. Select the Automobilista Wine prefix in the `Game's Wine prefix` dropdown
3. Launch the game
4. Click **Start tracking** to begin tracking and wait for about 10 seconds
5. Click **Stop tracking**
6. Restart the game
7. Click **Start tracking**

## Automobilista Setup
Once LookPilot is running, launch the game and head tracking should work automatically.

## Troubleshooting
If head tracking is not working, try using a higher Proton version. Proton 3.7 is known not to work with this game. Proton 10 has been tested and confirmed to work.

To change Proton version:
1. Right-click the game in Steam
2. Go to `Properties` → `Compatibility`
3. Check `Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool`
4. Select Proton 10 or higher from the dropdown
