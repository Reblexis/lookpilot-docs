## Native TrackIR Support

**Status:** No native TrackIR support

Half-Life 2 does not have native TrackIR or FreeTrack support. Head tracking requires third-party mods or workarounds.

## Possible Workarounds

### Option 1: Connect to Any Game Guide
You can try the generic [Connect to Any Game](../../app-docs/connect-to-any-game/linux.md) guide, but success is not guaranteed.

### Option 2: Third-Party Mods
Check community resources for Source Engine head tracking mods. Note that some mods may not be compatible with multiplayer or VAC-protected servers.

## Important Notes
- **Multiplayer:** Using third-party tools or mods may risk VAC bans in multiplayer games
- **Compatibility:** Source Engine games vary in their ability to accept external input modifications
- **Support Level:** This game is not officially verified for head tracking
- **Wine/Proton:** Additional complexity when running through compatibility layers
