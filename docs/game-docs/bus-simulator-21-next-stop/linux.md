## LookPilot Configuration

**Note:** This game requires selecting the running game process instead of the Wine prefix due to its launcher architecture.

4. Click **Start tracking** to begin tracking and wait for about 10 seconds
5. Click **Stop tracking**
6. Restart the game

4. Launch the game from Steam
5. Click **Start tracking** to begin tracking and wait for about 10 seconds
6. Click **Stop tracking**
7. Restart the game
8. Click **Start tracking**
