# Setting up LookPilot with Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 (Windows)

## LookPilot Configuration

1. Launch LookPilot and ensure your head tracking device is connected
2. In the **Output** tab, select `SimConnect` protocol
3. Click **Start** to begin tracking
4. Go to the **Mapping** tab to adjust curves for smooth flight experience

## MSFS 2020 Setup

1. Launch LookPilot before starting MSFS 2020
2. Start Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020
3. Go to **Options** → **Camera**
4. Enable **Head Tracking** option
5. Adjust sensitivity settings as needed

> **✈️ Flight Tip:** Use moderate sensitivity for realistic cockpit movement and better immersion.

## Troubleshooting

### No tracking detected
- Ensure LookPilot is started before MSFS 2020
- Check that SimConnect protocol is selected
- Verify head tracking is enabled in MSFS camera options
- Restart both applications if needed

### Too sensitive or not sensitive enough
- Adjust sensitivity in MSFS camera options
- Fine-tune curves in LookPilot Mapping tab
- Try different curve presets for flight simulation

### Jittery or unstable tracking
- Increase smoothing in LookPilot mapping
- Lower the update rate if experiencing performance issues
- Check for interference from other applications
