## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `auto`
2. Launch the game (you might need to customize the [Proton version](https://www.protondb.com/app/928600))
3. Go back to LookPilot
4. Select the game process (the name might not match)
5. Click **Start tracking**

Tracking should start (look for a green light on the top right corner) immediately, but needs a few tweaks to work in game (see below).

## F1 2019 Setup
