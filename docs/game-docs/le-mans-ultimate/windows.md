## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `freetrack`
2. Click **Start** to begin tracking

## Le Mans Ultimate Setup
Head tracking should work automatically as the game detects TrackIR/Freetrack-compatible devices. If it doesn't respond, check the game's settings for a TrackIR or head tracking option that may need to be enabled.
