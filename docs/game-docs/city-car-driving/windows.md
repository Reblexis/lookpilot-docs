## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `freetrack`
2. Click **Start** to begin tracking

## City Car Driving Setup
Once LookPilot is running, launch the game. Head tracking support may vary by version - check the game's Settings → Controls for TrackIR options, or you may need to edit the `game.ini` file in `Documents\Forward Development\City Car Driving\config` and set `EnableTrackIr=true`.
