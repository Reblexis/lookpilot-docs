## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `freetrack`
2. Click **Start** to begin tracking

## Assetto Corsa Setup
Assetto Corsa has **native support** for TrackIR/Freetrack head tracking, so setup is straightforward.

### In-Game Configuration
1. Launch Assetto Corsa
2. Go to `OPTIONS` → `VIEW` (or `SETTINGS` → `VIEW`)
3. Adjust the following settings:
   - **Lock to Horizon**: Set to around 50% for a natural feeling while still sensing the car's camber
   - **Camera movement sensitivity**: Adjust to your preference

### Tips for Sim Racing
- Start with subtle movements and increase sensitivity gradually
- Focus primarily on **Yaw** (looking left/right) movement for mirror checks and apex viewing
- Looking into corners and checking mirrors becomes natural after a short adjustment period
- Head tracking provides a significant competitive advantage in awareness
