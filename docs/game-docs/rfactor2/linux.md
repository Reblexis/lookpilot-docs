## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `auto` or `freetrack (Wine)`
2. Launch the game
3. Select the `rfactor2` process
4. Click **Start tracking**

Tracking should start (look for a green light on the top right corner) once you're on the track.

## rFactor2 Setup
Head tracking should work automatically. If it doesn't respond, check the game's settings for a TrackIR or head tracking option that may need to be enabled.
