## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `auto`
2. Launch the game
3. Select the F1 2018 Wine prefix in the `Game's Wine prefix` dropdown
4. Click **Start tracking** to begin tracking

### Fallback Option
If the above method doesn't work, try using the freetrack (Proton) protocol:

1. Set protocol to `freetrack (Proton)`
2. Select your Steam installation from the dropdown
3. Set Game to `F1 2018` in the game dropdown
4. Launch the game from Steam
5. Click **Start tracking** to begin tracking

## F1 2018 Setup
Once LookPilot is running and configured, head tracking should work automatically. If not, check the game's settings for camera or head tracking options (typically in Settings → Camera Settings or similar).
