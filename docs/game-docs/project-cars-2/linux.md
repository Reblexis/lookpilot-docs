## LookPilot Configuration
1. Set protocol to `auto`
2. Launch the game in **Steam VR mode**
3. Go back to LookPilot
4. Select the game process (the name might not match)
5. Click **Start tracking**

Tracking should start (look for a green light on the top right corner) immediately, but needs a few tweaks to work in game (see below).

## Project CARS 2 Setup

Camera should be following your head movements from the pits.
